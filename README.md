## Curtain

Curtain is data administration tool targetes not only for programmers.
It uses the modern approach of interpreting the data in such a way it is presented in a usable and meaningful way.

Traditional data editing tools force you to deal with primary and foreign keys. It is your additional task to make sure that the keys you are using corresponds to the a record in their corresponding tables.

Curtain is closing the gap to make that easier by presenting foreign keys as lookup to their corresponding table and presented it as drop down list of the records from the table.

We don't even use the term primary and foreign keys for they are simply just lookup records for those who are non-programmers.
